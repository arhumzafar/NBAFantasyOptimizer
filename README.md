# NBA Fantasy Optimizer
#### Arhum Zafar - May 2020

<br>
This project was created for CS 524: Optimization. [Spring 2020]
<br>
<br>
With the help of https://www.basketball-reference.com, my group and I obtained a dataset containing the salary, stats, position, 
and more for every NBA player in the 2019-2020 NBA Season. From there, we applied constraints due to the salary cap and luxury tax, amount of players on a roster,
and ensuring players can a fill a starter's position when they're injured/not playing.

The notebook, written in Julia, provides a deeper background into fantasy basketball, how the game is played, how our group uses regression to
apply weights to different in game stats, and the resulting teams our fantasy optimizer creates. This project is an example of a non-linear program (NLP).
