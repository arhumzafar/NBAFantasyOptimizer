    "\n",
    "In the 1980's, a New York City sportswriter named Daniel Okrent created fantasy sports with the idea of allowing sports fans to experience a side of sports that they had never experienced. Fantasy sports are internet simulation-based games where players assemble virtual teams of actual professional players. These professional players are ranked by their statistical in-game performance and are then selected by users who place them on their respective teams. These teams then compete against one another based on the performance of team's players in actual games. In a standard fantasy league, winning games results in points that a team gets to keep. At the end of the fantasy season, the team with the most points wins the league (the championship). In fantasy basketball, a **fantasy score** is a metric that considers the fundamental statistics (games played, field goal %, three-point%, points per game, rebounds, turnovers, and more) in a basketball game as a number. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![harden](harden.png)<br>\n",
    "In the above image, ***Total*** corresponds to the player's fantasy score.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the past couple of years, fantasy basketball has been growing with increasing popularity. This emerging increase has resulted in the demand of fantasy players to find a way to increase their chances of success with their fantasy team. From simulation software, to predictive analytics, many different tools/methods currently exist to aid fantasy users on which players to select onto their teams, each with their own pros and cons. To address this demand, our group attempted to create the ideal tool that fantasy players can use to build their perfect team.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we have built an optimization model that takes all 450 current players in the NBA and builds the best fantasy team possible in order to guarantee success in a fantasy basketball league. This model considers each player’s fantasy score, position, salary, team, and more to find whether or not a respective player is the right fit. Additionally, the model also considers which players are best suited to come off the bench as “backup”, when certain players are injured or are not playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected our data, including in-game statistics, player salary, position, and more on all NBA players in the 2019-2020 season from [Hashtag Basketball](https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-rankings) and [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). Both websites refresh and update their data logs daily (while the season is ongoing), ensuring data accuracy and reliability. In order to collect this data, we copy the appropriate stat charts and place them into an Excel spreadsheet."

    "## 2. Mathematical model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are trying to create a fantasy team using players with high fantasy scores, we want to **maximize the team's average fantasy score**, subject to the applicable constraints. There is one set of primary decision variables (**selected**) and 3 major constraints: <br> \n",
    "### (1) The number of players on a team<br>\n",
    "In basketball, a team must have 5 of its players on the floor at any given time. Our optimization model will consider the number of open spots on the team, and will select players to fit those positions. Additionally, the model will also choose *bench players* that provide backup for the starting 5.\n",
    "### (2) A salary constraint considering the NBA's current salary cap<br>\n",
    "As NBA players are known for their lucrative salaries, teams must decide what players they choose based on what they can afford. In the NBA, a **salary cap** is *the maximum range of money that a team is allowed to spend on their players*. In the 2019-2020 season, the NBA salary cap falls between **109 Million to 132 Million US Dollars**. Our optimization model will choose players, considering their respective salaries, to build the optimal fantasy team while falling within the recommended team salary range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) A position constraint requiring that all 5 positions on the court are filled by appropriate players. <br>\n",
    "In basketball, there are 5 positions on the court: Point Guard (PG), Shooting Guard (SG), Small Forward/Forward (SF/F), Power Forward (PF), and Center (C). The optimization model will pick players that can play these positions, as well as choose backup players in the case where our starters are injured or are not playing in a game.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "All of these constraints will be applied to consider every single player in the NBA in order to create the most ideal fantasy team. The problem could be described as the following model: <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\underset{selected}{\\text{maximize}}\\qquad& \\sum_{n=1}^{12} selected * rank_{i} \\\\\n",

    "***P*** is the number of players in our dataset, which is about 450. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "***selected*** is a P x 1 matrix representing whether a player is chosen to be on the team; assigned a **1** if they are selected, **0** if not. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "***rank*** is a P x 1 matrix representing the overall fantasy score for each player, with the maximum rank being 100.\n",
    "* **rank_i** $\\leq$ 100\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>***salary*** is a P x 1 matrix that contains the respective salaries for each player in *millions of US Dollars.* <br>\n",
    "* \\$109Millon & \\\\$132 Million are the respective lower and upper bounds for the NBA Salary Cap for the 2019-2020 season.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "* **position**[i j] is assigned a **1** if player *i* can play position *j*\n",

    "The current pandemic affects the finances of NBA season drastically. The collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players guarantees players a certain percentage of the league's basketball-related income (BRI) every year. That can range from 49-51 percent and most of that figure goes into the salary cap. However, games played without fans in the stands would cost the league a fortune not only in ticket sales, but in food, beverage, parking and merchandise sales. Television ratings might soar in a socially-distanced society, but with rights locked up years in advance, the NBA itself won't see the benefits. Its partners at ESPN and Turner News Network (TNT) would. What if games are called off entirely? That's money that the league has to return. In reality, the burden of loss will be shared by the league and the players. This would largely affect the salary caps for coming years. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility is that rather than drastically lowering the cap all at once, the NBA could build the losses from this season into the cap for the next several years. In some form or another, this is probably what ends up happening. \n"

    "The overall purpose of this project was to solve a *real-life* optimization problem using the fundamentals that we have learned in class this semester. In our group's project, the **NBA Fantasy Optimizer**, we successfully created an optimization model that takes in a dataset of NBA players, their fantasy score, salary, position, and more, to create the optimal fantasy team that would yield success in the most competitive fantasy leagues. We created this model as a tool to serve fantasy basketball users worldwide, and are confident with its functionality. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To take things a step further, we also created another version of our model to consider all of the in-game statistics that are recorded on behalf of each player in the NBA. The new model uses linear regression to assign weights to each of the statistics, then creates the optimal fantasy team. When looking at the fantasy teams that are created from running our model(s), one would recognize the several All-Star/MVP caliber players that are listed, displaying the depth and strength of the fantasy team that our model(s) output. As a group, we are pleased with the quality of results that our optimization model gives us, and would love to see others input their own NBA datasets into the model to enhance their fantasy teams.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Going forward, our group came up with an idea that could be an interesting add-on to our existing model. Currently, the optimization model only has constraints based on position, fantasy score, advanced statistics, and salary. But what if a fantasy user wanted to apply another constraint of their choice to the model? This new idea would allow them to do so. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*For example, if a fantasy user wanted to create the best possible NBA fantasy team using only players younger than 25 years old, he/she could use a new constraint called* ***AGE*** *which would only consider players that are at or below a selected age. Additionally, if a user only wanted to select players for certain teams, he/she could use a new constraint called* ***TEAM***, *would which be a dictionary containing a list of desired teams to select players from*. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If this follow-up idea was implemented, fantasy users would be able to utilize new constraints like those above to enhance their experience with the model."
